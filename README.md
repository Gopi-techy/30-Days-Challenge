# 30 Days POC: Cloud, Tech, DevOps & Git

Welcome to the **30 Days Proof of Concept (POC)** challenge! This repository documents a 30-day journey exploring foundational concepts and hands-on exercises in Cloud, Technology, DevOps, and Git.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a structured, practical introduction to essential tools and workflows in modern development, with a focus on:

- **Cloud Computing** (basics, platforms, deployments)
- **Tech Fundamentals** (scripting, containers, automation)
- **DevOps Principles** (CI/CD, monitoring, collaboration)
- **Git Version Control** (workflows, branching, collaboration)

Each day features a concise lesson, hands-on task, or mini-project to build your skills and confidence.

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for container days)
- Access to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS Free Tier, Azure, or GCP) â€“ optional but recommended
